      <p> I was in the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority for three years. It pushed me to be way more social and outgoing. My favorite events were Greek Week each year and going through recruitment before the school year started. Recruitment is a huge bonding time as we spend two weeks with each other preparing for the new members. Lipsync was another great way to get involved during the spring semesters and it was a good way to get to know the different fraternities as well. While I may no longer be apart of this sorority, there is no doubt I made longlasting friends. </p>

        <p>Each year, I made sure to go to as many ISU football games as I could. I loved going to the tailgates with everyone! The fall is my favorite time of year so I always loved dressing up in red and yellow with all of my friends and cheering on the Cyclones to victory. My favorite memory was having my brother at Iowa State when he was a senior so I had him not only at the tailgates, but there to support me as I started my freshman year in Ames. I even went to Kansas City with my family to watch the Cyclones play at the Chiefs stadium. My love for Rocco Becht was as strong as ever! #loyalforevertrue!</p>

      <p>As I got older, I became more involved outside of greek life. I joined the student organization, Winterfest, in 2022 where I met one of my closest friends, Abby. We instantly hit it off. It was so awesome to create such a wonderful event where we could explore ways to get creative with the activities hosted at the Memorial Union while promoting it on social media. My favorite memory was ice skating with all of the staff members at the end of the night after trying to make Winterfest a success. I also met so many wonderful people in my junior year PR 424 class. We learned how to create an IMC Plan and presented our work where we got first place! It felt less like a team of people and more like actual friends with great memories. It was truly an educational, resume building time that I would not trade for the world!</p>

      <p>Once I turned 21, I was so excited to go to all the Ames bars. Most of the time, I would go out with my friend Mya, where we would have a blast at Thursday mug nights. My favorite moments were going out to Wednesday night "dollars" during the fall semester on a weekly basis and watching the Cyclones win in the Cyhawk game at BNC. One time Mya wrote her name with sharpie on the Cy's wall. She would sign any and everything! I loved to dance the night away on the Outlaws dance floor and enjoy the nice outdoors of the AJ's patio. Sips and Paddy's were great for catching up with friends too. I'm lucky enough to have had such an amazing time with everyone whenever I went out. Welch Ave you will be missed!</p>
